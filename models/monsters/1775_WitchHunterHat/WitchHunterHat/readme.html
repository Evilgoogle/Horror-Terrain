This model works well with the villager models, reasonable with both the Arthas and the Paladin model (hair goes through, but it's not noticeable, I swear.), does not work with Priest, Knight, Demon Hunter or Kobold Shoveler because their head attachment point is apparently either directly on their chin or floating above their head...<br />
EDIT: Fiddled with the positioning, just might work properly with Arthas and the Paladins now.<br /><br /><b>Textures:</b><br /><ul style="margin: 0px;"><li>None</li></ul><br />Please give me credit for my work<br />Do not redistribute this model without consent!<br /><br />Model was uploaded 2010, June 24<br />Model was last updated 2010, June 30<br /><br /><br />Visit <a href="http://www.hiveworkshop.com">The Hive Workshop</a> for more downloads
