Soul Edge History:
Soul Edge was created by human hands. 
At first it was just an ordinary sword, but after being bathed in blood and hatred countless times, the sword turned into a demonic weapon and gained a wicked soul called Inferno. 
Those without strong wills are unable to escape the curse of its evil powers. 
While it burns fiercely with the regret of lost souls, its blade shines with an icy gleam.
